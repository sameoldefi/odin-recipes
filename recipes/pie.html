    </ul>

    <p>The making of this recipe</p>
    <ol><em><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Mashed potatoes</strong></em>
        <li>Start by peeling and cutting 3 pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes in half.<br>
             Put them in a large sauce pot and cover with cold water. </li><br>
        <li>Boil for about 20 minutes, or until a paring knife cuts through with<br>
             no resistance. Drain and place back in the warm pot. </li><br>
        <li>Place over medium-low heat, stir around and cook gently for about 1 minute.</li><br>
        <li>Kill the heat and add 3-4 ounces (depending on how cheesy you like your potatoes)<br>
             aged Irish white cheddar, ½ cup unsalted butter, and ½ cup chives (optional).</li><br>
        <li>Using a masher, or potato ricer, mash everything together.<br>
             Add kosher salt and white pepper to season. </li><br>
        <li>Add 2 egg yolks to ½ cup of milk and beat together. Add to the now-kind-of-cooled-down<br>
             potatoes and giving it one more mix and mash. </li><br>
    </ol>

    <ol><em><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Meat Stew and Peas</strong></em>
        <li>Start by finely mincing half a large onion and 3-4 medium carrots.<br>
             Chop a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme and crush the garlic. </li><br>
        <li>In a lightly oiled and preheated stainless steel pan,<br>
             place 1 pound of ground lamb (or ground beef if you prefer).<br>
              Break it up in the pan until brown. Drain any excess fat,<br>
               but leave 2-3 Tbsp in the pan.</li><br>
        <li>Add the finely minced onion and saute for 2-3 minutes,<br>
             until soft and translucent around the edges.<br>
              Add the carrots and saute them for 2-3 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Make a hole in the middle of the pan and add the crushed garlic and tomato paste. </li><br>
        <li>Mix together and saute for 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped rosemary and thyme and stir.</li><br>
        <li>To make the sauce, add 1 Tbsp flour to the mixture and mix until the raw
             flour smell is gone and a fond has formed on the bottom of the pot (about 2-3 minutes). </li><br>
        <li>Deglaze with 1 cup of dark Irish Stout and 1 cup beef's broth.<br>
             Make sure to scrape up all the fond at the bottom while mixing.<br>
              Add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Optional:<br>
               now is when you can add 1 Tbsp Madeira and 1 puck<br>
                of frozen demi-glace if you have it.<a href="https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/bone-broth" target="_blank">See Bone Broth for the demi-glace recipe.</a></li><br>
        <li>Cook and mix together until thick. When you drag<br>
             a spoon through the mixture, it should leave a trail.</li><br>
        <li>In a separate pot, cook up some fresh peas. Frozen peas work<br>
             just as fine and better. Set aside for pie assembly.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol><em><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Shepherd's Pie Assembly</strong></em>
        <li>Spoon the stew mixture onto a pie plate. Top with cooked peas. Lastly,<br>
             top with the mashed potatoes. You can use a pastry bag<br>
              or a Ziploc bag with the corner cut off.</li><br>
        <li>Even out the potatoes with an offset spatula. Use a fork to rough it up<br>
             to make sure there are enough nooks and crannies that will brown and get crispy. </li><br>
        <li>Set the pie plate on a sheet of parchment paper set in a rimmed baking sheet.<br>
             Place in a 350°F oven for about 25 minutes. Remove at the 15 minute mark<br>
              to top with more grated cheddar (optional) and place back in the oven<br>
               for the remaining 10 minutes. You can also broil it the last 2-3 minutes for extra brown and crispy. </li>
    </ol>

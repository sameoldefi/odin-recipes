    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl separate egg whites from 2 eggs and beat the whites until frothy.<br>
             Add 3 Tbsp dark soy sauce, 3 Tbsp chinese cooking wine, and 3 Tbsp vodka.<br>
              Beat together and set aside half for later use. In the same large bowl<br>
               where half mixture remains, add ¼ tsp of baking soda and 3 Tbsp cornstarch,<br>
                and whisk until smooth. Cut chicken into 1 inch pieces and add to mixture.<br>
                 Mix together by hand, making sure every piece is coated.<br>
                  Cover and set aside for about 20 minutes. </li><br>
        <li>In your shallow breading dish, combine 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup cornstarch,<br>
             1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt. Pour in 3 Tbsp reserved marinade and<br>
              incorporate using your fingers until it's clumpy. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Make the sauce: In a small bowl goes 4 Tbsp dark soy sauce, 4 Tbsp chinese cooking wine,<br>
             3 Tbsp rice wine vinegar, 4 Tbsp chicken stock, ¼ cup sugar, 1 tsp roasted sesame seed oil,<br>
              and 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Whisk until completely smooth. </li><br>
        <li>From 6 scallions, thinly slice all whites and 2 inches of the green.<br>
             Next grate 4 cloves garlic and 2 inches of ginger. In a saute pan over medium high heat,<br>
              simmer 2 Tbsp vegetable oil and add most of scallions, grated garlic, and grated ginger.<br>
               Saute for one minute. Add a dozen arbol chiles (optional) and saute for another minute.<br>

        <li>Heat a quart of vegetable oil to 375°F. Coat chicken in the breading flour mixture<br>
             while it's heating. Then add to frying oil one piece at a time and make sure not to crowd,<br>
              cooking each batch for about 4 minutes. Place batches on wire rack that's set<br>
               on a rimmed sheet pan, and place in oven on low heat. Repeat until all chicken is fried. </li><br>

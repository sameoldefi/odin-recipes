        <br>
        i know that tommorow this recipe will be my dinner
    </p>
    <p>So Let's start with the ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One 24-ounce boneless ribeye</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces sweet and hot peppers, sliced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 dense, chewy sandwich loaf</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The making of this recipe</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Salt the ribeye, and place on a wire rack in a sheet pan.  Freeze for 30 minutes,<br>
             or until firm to the touch.  With a very sharp knife,<br>
              slice the ribeye as thin as possible - do not trim off fat.</li><br>
        <li>In a large cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high flame, until shimmering.<br>
              Add half the beef in an even layer - don't overcrowd the pan.<br>
            Let beef fry undisturbed for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and crispy.<br>
              Flip and continue to fry, until evenly browned and crisp.<br>
                Arrange the beef in a long pile in the center of the pan, and top with cheese,<br>
                 reducing heat to medium-low, until cheese has melted.</li><br>
        <li>Split loaf and dress with ketchup and mayo - top with beef and peppers,<br>
             cut in half, and serve.  Repeat with remaining beef for second sandwich.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Hope you will love this one!</p>

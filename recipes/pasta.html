    <p>So Let's start with the ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 head garlic, separated and peeled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, rinsed and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup good quality olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 pound dry linguine</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The making of this recipe</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heavily salt a large pot of water, and bring to a boil.<br>
             Cook pasta until slightly underdone while completing the steps below.</li><br>
        <li>Slice the garlic cloves thinly, and set aside. Heat olive oil in a large<br>
             saut√© pan over medium heat until barely shimmering. Add sliced garlic,<br>
              stirring constantly, until softened and turning golden on the edges.<br>
               Add the red pepper flakes and lower the heat to medium-low.</li><br>
        <li>Add the pasta, drained, with about 1/4 cup reserved pasta cooking water.<br>
             Squeeze lemon juice over top, and mix into the pasta with the fresh parsley.<br>
              If sauce is too watery, continue to cook for 1-3 minutes,<br>
               until pasta has absorbed more liquid. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
